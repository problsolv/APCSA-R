 * In the future, I will continue to look at examples and replicating them through codes.
 * I will be more careful when writing lines to reduce typos.
 * I do not completely know what printf() is, but I don't think I'll use it a lot.
 * Hopefully, after taking this course, I can fluently code in java, so I can participate in my school competitive programming club.
