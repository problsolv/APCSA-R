 * @purpose This program performs order of operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
 * and modulus on decimals (doubles) and integers (ints).
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * I replaced individual values with variables representing them. I defined int and double variables and used them to replace constants in the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division equations.
 * Editing the concatenation in each print statement was tedious though. I constantly got errors when I forgot to put a plus sign between 2 strings.
