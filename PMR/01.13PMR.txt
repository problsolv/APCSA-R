 * @purpose This program converts an amount of money from a specific country into the equivalent
 * currency of another country given the current exchange rate.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * I used the Exchange Rate website for currency conversions.
 * The declaration of variables took the most time, while the print statements were not very complicated.
 * The souvenir part of the program was a little funny since it wouldn't make sense for someone to buy 8 or 16 of the same items, but easy to follow.
