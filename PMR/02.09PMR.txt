 * @purpose This program uses 3 different methods and return functions to calculate order of operations
 * with the numbers 10 and 5.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * I used 4 different methods: a main method, addition, multiplication, and division methods to do mathematics.
 * I enjoyed doing this program because it teaches how to make different methods, so I can run the program over and over again.
 * I've learned functions in Python before, and now I can use it in Java too.
