 * @purpose This program asks the user for their information and orders using parsing, strings, substrings,
 * and order of operations.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was straightforward and only parsing and substrings were required. It was tedious writing prints and scanners for variables.
 * In the future, I would look more into details when typing long sentences with variables.
