 * @purpose This program asks the user for their BMR and other information, then asks for how much
 * exercise or labor they get in order to calculate their active factor or total daily energy expenditure.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was mostly straightforward. I used multiplication to calculate a user's total daily energy expenditure.
 * This could be applied in real life, like those online calculators.
 * In the future, I hope to write more of these types of programs related to users' health.
