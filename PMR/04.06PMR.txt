 * @purpose This program is for users to input the number of characters they want
 * their passwords to be, and have the system generate a password from the ASCII table for them.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * So far, this project was the hardest. I originally wanted to make only one method to run everything, but I realized I had to create 3 methods to
 * allow the user to create many passwords. Using print writer was complicated, but I used a try-catch method to prevent reimporting it.
 * Eventually, I changed some code to make only 1 method, and I was able to remove the try-catch method which was easier to follow.
