 * This project was rather challenging because creating so many methods created syntax errors.
 * I forgot how to use return statements to the main method, but I read the 02.09 lesson again, and I remembered.
 * I noticed that step 4 was always 1089 no matter what the starting number was.
 * Step 5 and 6 were the same too, which made me confused first, but I did the math and proved that it would always be 1089.
