 * @purpose This program calculates different planets' surface gravity
 * using print, methods, and math libraries.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was simple because I knew how to create different methods and return different types of variables.
 * One challenge was simplifying the mass value to only 2-3 digits, followed by "E27". The original mass was 1.8999999999998E27, which
 * took up lots of space, but I managed to use substrings and parsing to save space.
