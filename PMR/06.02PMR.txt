 * @purpose This program prints out weather and precipitation data using arrays and printf statements.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * Using objects and writing the arrays were easy, but formatting the result table was difficult since using \t would make too big of a gap.
 * Writing the methods in the implementation class was also easy, but hard at the beginning because I forgot how to use a for loop to print
 * values in an array.
