 * MAGPIE PROJECT:
 * @purpose A program to carry on conversations with a human user.
 * This is the initial version that:
 *     - Uses indexOf to find strings
 *     - Handles responding to simple words and phrases
 * This version uses a nested if to handle default responses.
 * Code adapted from work by Laurie White for the College Board.
 *
 * STRING EXPLORER:
 * A program to allow students to try out different
 * String methods.
 * Code adapted from work by Laurie White for the College Board.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was rather harder because I didn't necessarily understand how to extract keywords from the user's input.
 * But I figured to extract for spaces before and after the input to stop the program from extracting substrings, for example
 * "no" from the word "know" and "mother" from "smothered". Using indexOf, substring, compareTo, toLowercase, etc. were all
 * review from module 2.
