 * @purpose This program calculates ingredients needed to make a cheesecake.
 * It creates cheesecakes and use printf statements to create the output.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was easy because I knew how to use printf statements to print out every value.
 * I enjoyed using each constructor in the Implementation class to calculate the amount of cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and serving size.
 * Also, I learned to never use those flavors to make a cheesecake.
