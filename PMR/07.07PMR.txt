 * @purpose This program calculates election results and data for the Election of 1860.
 * It uses ArrayList, arrays and insertion and deletion methods to crete candidates and the number of votes they received.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was a bit harder because I kept making silly mistakes in the Array version of the program.
 * Using insertion and deletion were easy for ArrayList because I could use the set, add, and remove function.
 * For Array insertion, I first extracted the last object, then put each value one to the right, assigned the new object
 * at the desired location, and finally, added the last object back into the array.
 * For Array deletion, I moved each value one value to the left, then set the last value to a null.
