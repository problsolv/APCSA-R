 * @version 09/05/2022
 * @purpose This program creates a grade book for instructors to use.
 * It can add, remove, and replace students' scores and names.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was easy because it was almost the same as the ones before (7.04 through 7.07).
 * Using ArrayList was quite easy since I could use the add, remove, and set method to make the table quickly.
