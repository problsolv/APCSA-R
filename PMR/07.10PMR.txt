 * @purpose This program uses selection sort to sort movies based on their name, year produced, and production company.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was easy because it was just changing the insertion sort methods to selection sort.
 * Selection sort's algorithm is easy because it swaps values based on their values. It does not swap each value, unlike insertion sort.
