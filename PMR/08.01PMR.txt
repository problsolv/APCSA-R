 * @purpose This program uses sequential search to find song's titles, artists, and year produced and outputs
 * the song's information if found and null if not found.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was easy because there were not too many songs in the array, so it was easy to keep track.
 * Creating those static methods were easy because I had the example in the textbook as a reference.
 * I changed it to a for-each loop instead of a while loop.
