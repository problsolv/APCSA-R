 * @purpose This program uses sequential search to find song's titles, artists, and year produced and outputs
 * the song's information if found and null if not found.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was harder than the last one. Using binary search to search for the titles and artists
 * was quite hard. I still managed to use the print methods to print out the search results using a statement
 * that prints the song information if the array element at probe and probe + 1 is equal to the target.
