 * @purpose This program uses sequential and binary search to find a person's
 * name, relationship, birthday month, phone number, and email. It then outputs
 * the song's information if found and null if not found.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was easier than the last 2 projects because I was already quite familiar to binary and
 * sequential search. Searching for the birthday month was a bit challenging since I forgot that I had to
 * search for the month using substring(0, 3) instead of substring(0, 2).
