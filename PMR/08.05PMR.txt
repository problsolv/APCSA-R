 * @version 10/06/2022
 * @purpose This program uses 2D Arrays to create objects of projectiles being launched by
 * a catapult to calculate the range of the projectile using Math.sin and toRadians.
 * There are 2 factors involved are the speed and the degrees that it is launched.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was rather easy because I already knew 2D arrays from Python. It was only a bit
 * harder when I tried to convert the mph to mps and the meters to feet. I discovered that the
 * calcRange() method was unnecessary, but kept it for demonstration purposes.
