 * PICTURE EXPLORER:
 * @purpose This program displays images using libraries in java.
 *
 * INTEGER ARRAY WORKER:
 * @purpose This program calculates the number of times an element appears,
 * the largest integer in an array, the sum of all elements, and the total number of elements.
 * In Activity 4, modify this class to include the methods:
 *    getCount
 *    getLargest
 *    getColTotal
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was harder than the other projects because there were quite a lot of warnings
 * detected by IntelliJ. The integer array worker was easy because I knew how to deal with 2D arrays.
