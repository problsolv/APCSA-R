 * @purpose This program uses superclasses and subclasses to create all sorts of circular
 * 2D and 3D objects with centers, radii, and heights.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was quite easy because I was repeating polymorphism many times. Writing the
 * client class was easy because I was repeating declaring the circle class.
