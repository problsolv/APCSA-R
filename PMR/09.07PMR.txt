 * @purpose This program uses static methods, static variables, and constants to encrypt and
 * decrypt messages inputted by users.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was a harder program to write because there were many steps involved when
 * encrypting and decrypting the messages. I figured that using char for the arrays was easier
 * than using String because char can account for the ASCII value of the character.
