 * @purpose This program identifies the prime integers between any 2 given integers from the user.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was hard at first because I did not know how to filter the prime numbers,
 * but I thought that a number must not have any factors greater than half of itself, which
 * made me understand the algorithm.
