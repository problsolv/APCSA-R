 * @purpose This program allows the user to find the nth term of the Fibonacci Sequence,
 * where n is between 0 and 45.
 ***************************************** P M R ******************************************
 * This project was easy because I already understood the recursion algorithm and how the
 * Fibonacci Sequence worked. Writing the recursion method was fairly easy because it resembled
 * the methods in the piecewise functions.
